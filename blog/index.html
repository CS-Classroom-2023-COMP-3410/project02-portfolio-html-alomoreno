        <h2>First Day of Winter Quarter.</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 6, 2025</p>
        <p>Today was the first day back from winter break, and I started my  Web programming class. I'm very excited to see the progess I make in this class, and it will be a good addition to 
            my resume. So far, we started off strong with using AI to build a basic starter HTML website. I'm excited to see what else we will be doing in this class.

            Today I flew back to Denver from Oklahoma City. I had a great time with my family and friends, but I'm excited to be back in Denver. I'm excited to see my friends and get back to my routine. 
            I'm also excited to start my winter quarter classes tomorrow.
