Project 2: Development Process

For this project I used my pre-exisiting CS website and modified it by including new pages, such as the about me, contact, gallery, and blog. 

The main struggles for me during this process was getting the images and video to display correctly, for a while they only popped up as broken images. Once passing that barrier, the rest was pretty straight foward. 
The next roadblock I faced was getting the folders connected to my pre-exisiting public_html directory. For this I had to completely delete the directory and create a new one then conencted it to the linux2 server.
